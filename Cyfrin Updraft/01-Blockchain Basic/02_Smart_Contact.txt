1) What is the value of smart contact ?
- Trust Minimised Aggrements
- Unbreakable Promises

2) The Purpose of smart contract is Immutable, Decentralized &b Transparent
- A smart contact is an  agggrements contract or set of instructions that is deployed on a decentralized blockchain
- Cannot be altered
- Automatically executes
- Everyone can sees the terms of the agggrements


3) Key Features and Benefits
- Decentralization
- Transparency and Flexibility
- Speed and Efficiency
- Security and Immutability
- Reduced Counterparty Risk
- Trust Minimised agreements

4) Chainlink
Chainlink is a decentralized network that facilitates the creation of hybrid smart contracts. By combining on-chain logic with off-chain data and computation, they ensure that both the logic and the data remain decentralized.
