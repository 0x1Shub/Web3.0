1) What is Smart Contract ??
A smart contract is a computer program that runs on a blockchain and automatically does what it’s designed to do when certain conditions are met.

Think of it like a digital vending machine:

You put in some coins (that’s your transaction).

The machine checks if the amount is correct.

If yes, it automatically gives you the product — no cashier needed.

Similarly, a smart contract:

Lives on the blockchain (like Ethereum).

Has rules written in code (for example, “If someone sends 1 ETH, give them a token”).

Executes automatically — no middleman, no waiting.

Example:

If you write a smart contract for fundraising:

People can send money to it.

The contract automatically keeps track of who sent what.

When the target is reached, it can release the funds — all automatically and transparently.
