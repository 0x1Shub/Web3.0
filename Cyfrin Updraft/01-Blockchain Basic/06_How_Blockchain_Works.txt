1) What is Hash ??
A unique fixed length string, meant to indetify a piece of data. They are created by placing said data into a "hash function"

SHA256 Algorithm

2) Ethereum uses Keccak-256 Algorithm


3) The miners need to find the nonce that solves the problem for mining. By keep trying the numbers


4) Ethereum is Proof of Stake


5) Genesis Block: 
The first block in a blockchain

6) Hash Algorithm : 
A function that computes data into a unique hash

7) What is mining ?? 
The process of finding the "solution" to the blockchain "problem"
In our example the "problem" was to find the hash that starts with four zeros.
Nodes gets paid for mining block 

8) What is Block ??
A list of transactions mined together

9) Nounce 
A number used once to find the solution for a blockchain problem
It is also used to define the transaction number for an account/address
